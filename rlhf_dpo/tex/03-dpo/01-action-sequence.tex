Implement the \texttt{ActionSequenceModel} class instance methods. When called, the model should return a probability distribution for the actions over the number of next time steps specified at initialization. Use a multivariate normal distribution for each action, with mean and standard deviation predicted by a neural network (see the starter code for more details).\footnote{We have prepared a \href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ChB5-epdpYsDPwp48m5UJ-5KH0Ge2V1g?usp=share_link}{notebook} to illustrate the behavior of \href{https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html\#independent}{\texttt{torch.distributions.Independent}}.}
