\section{Introduction}

In this assignment, we will be using the \href{https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/hopper/}{Hopper environment} where we will first derive reward functions for specific tasks, 
moving then to adding human preferences to learn the reward function and then ending the process with an end-to-end approach, where we skip the reward learning and reinforcement learning steps, 
and optimize the model directly from preference data.
