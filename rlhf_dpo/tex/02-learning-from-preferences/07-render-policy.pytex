\item \points{2g}

Pick one of the policies and render a video of the agent behavior at the end of training.

\begin{lstlisting}
$ python render.py --checkpoint ./results_rlhf/[MODEL]/model.zip
\end{lstlisting}

How does it compare to the behavior of the agent generated by policies trained from scratch? How does it compare to the demonstrations you've seen from the dataset?
